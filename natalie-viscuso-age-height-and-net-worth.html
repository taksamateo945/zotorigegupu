Her nationality is American, while her ethnicity is partly Caucasian. Natalie is the only child of her parents, Michael Viscuso and Tammie Kay Baumann.</p><p>Her mom was a businesswoman and architectural expert. Tammie ran her own company Expedite LA where she helped builders obtain permits and other needed documentation. She also worked for many architectural firms in Texas.</p><p>Tammie Kay passed away on 27th August 2017 as a result of cancer, and this devastated her daughter. Natalie still remembers her mom to this day and often posts sweet tributes to her on social media. She has described her mom as the strongest woman she knows and praised her incredible beauty, joy, and radiance even during her fight against cancer.</p><p>Natalie Viscuso’s father is Michael Viscuso, a wealthy entrepreneur. Michael owns several nightclubs and restaurants in the San Diego part of California, namely Entrada Restaurant and JJ Steakhouse. He is also the CEO of Covo La Jolla, a large, luxurious multi-purpose event center in downtown La Jolla, California.</p><p>Natalie Viscuso’s parents were never married, and she spent the first 15 years of her life living with her mom, aunt, and uncle in New Mexico. It was at the age of 15 that she relocated to San Diego, California, to live with her dad and his then girlfriend-turned-wife named Melissa.</p><h3><strong>She Appeared on MTV’s My Super Sweet 16 in 2005</strong></h3><p>It won’t be out of place to describe Natalie Viscuso as a reality TV star. Back in 2005, a 16-year-old Natalie appeared on an episode of MTV’s My Super Sweet 16 to celebrate her 16th birthday in grand style.</p><p>Her dad shelled out $450,000 for the ceremony, which was hosted at one of his nightclubs and had 1,000 people in attendance. Natalie wore a designer dress for the party and showed up in a Hummer. She got a manicure and pedicure that cost $800.</p><p>The young lady described how her life had transformed from her days in Roswell to living in her father’s $5 million mansion and driving his Ferraris and Bentleys. She also talked about her closet full of designer clothes and shoes. Natalie admitted that she was spoiled but stated that she deserved it.</p><h2><strong>Natalie Viscuso is the Vice President of Television at Vertigo Entertainment</strong></h2><p>Natalie grew up with a passion for storytelling and has made a career out of it, working at several production companies in Hollywood.</p><p>One of the companies where Natalie Viscuso made her mark is Legendary Entertainment. She served as their vice president of television and digital studios for many years. She worked on TV series such as Brujo, Dune: The Sisterhood, and The Auteur, a project involving the Oscar-winning filmmaker Taika Waititi.</p><p>In May 2022, Natalie Viscuso left Legendary Entertainment for Vertigo Entertainment. She is similarly the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">head</a> of television at the company. Previously, she worked at companies such as ITV Studios and the Weinstein Company.</p><p>She studied at the School of Cinematic Arts at USC and received her bachelor’s degree in 2011. In May 2022, Viscuso revealed on Instagram that genre storytelling had been her passion right from her childhood days. According to her, she was lucky to be able to build a career out of that passion and have the opportunity to work with the best in the business.</p><h2><strong>Natalie Viscuso’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Natalie Viscuso’s net worth is estimated at $1 million. Part of her fortune comes from the salaries she has earned as a high-ranking executive in a Hollywood production company. She must have also made some smart investments over the years, which will have yielded something tangible.</p><p>Viscuso may have also inherited some money, perhaps in the shape of a trust fund, from her dad. It is, however, possible that nothing of such has occurred yet, and her Dad is more interested in equipping her with the tools and resources to build her own wealth.</p><h2><strong>Natalie Viscuso and Henry Cavill Began Dating in 2021</strong></h2><p>While Natalie Viscuso is an accomplished woman in every sense of the word, she is now most famous as the girlfriend of Henry Cavill, the popular Hollywood actor who is known for his roles in works such as The Witcher and Black Adams.</p><p>Natalie Viscuso and Henry Cavill first sparked dating rumors in early 2021 after the tabloids clocked them taking a walk in London together. The story sparked a lot of speculations, and the duo mercifully put the public out of their misery by immediately confirming that they were an item.</p><p>Natalie and Cavill confirmed their romance via Instagram on 10 April 2021. They shared a picture of both of them playing chess with different captions on their Instagram accounts. Cavill described Natalie as brilliant and beautiful and stated that she was destroying him at chess. She, on the other hand, stated that she was teaching him how to play and alluded to the fact that he may have let her win.</p><h2><strong>The Two Remain Together Till Date and are Waxing Strong</strong></h2><p>Henry Cavill and Natalie Viscuso are still in a relationship to date, and their romance has grown strong over time. Following that confirmation back in April 2021, the couple has not bothered to hide their love from the world but has offered glimpses into what they share through social media posts and red-carpet appearances.</p><p>Cavill and Natalie made their debut red carpet appearance at the world premiere of Cavill’s movie, Enola Holmes 2, held in New York City on 27th October 2022. They also attended the premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water in London in December 2022.</p><p>Natalie Viscuso has also sent Cavill birthday wishes on Instagram and also celebrated his magazine interviews and covers as well. He himself has praised her for being amongst those who have given him the confidence to pursue his acting career.</p><h2><strong>What is Natalie Viscuso’s Height?</strong></h2><p>Natalie Viscuso is 5 feet 8 inches or 173 cm tall. This makes her taller than the average American woman out there. The height of the average American woman is put at 5 feet 4 inches, which means that Natalie is four inches taller.</p><p>She is, however, shorter than her boyfriend. Henry Cavill is 6 feet 1 inch or 1.85 m tall. This means that Natalie is five inches shorter than Henry Cavill.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLuiwMCloJ5lpp7ApMHSqGSan5Vitaa1xqGrZpmemXqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
