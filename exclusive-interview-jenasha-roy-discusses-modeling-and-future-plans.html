For those who are new, could you tell us a little about yourself to our readers?</strong></p><p>First of all, let me start by saying thank you for this interview . My name is Jenasha Roy and I am 15 years old. I’m a teen Sag actress and model. I was born in Hollywood, Florida, now currently residing in Los Angeles. I love to cook, listen to music and design clothes. I also love to spend time with my family and watch horror movies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/exclusive-interview-with-jenasha-roy-02.jpg><p><strong>This is cool. You started a career in modeling at an early age of seven. What made you continue modeling over all these years?</strong></p><p>I started modeling at the age of seven in Miami doing local print ads and a few runways here and there but it wasn’t until we came to Los Angeles and I got older and realized how much I love the world of fashion overall that I started to take it seriously.</p><p><strong>What do you love the most about your job? Do you ever think of going the traditional career route like regular youngsters?</strong></p><p>What I love the most about my job is being on set, seeing myself on the big screen, I love being on the runway and show off my catwalk signature & overall everything. Yes, I have a team: a manager and two agents one for theatrical and one for commercial and they follow the traditional route of the industry and that’s what I go by.</p><p><strong>Jenasha, you proudly carry your afro look on the runaway and off which is amazing. As a young black girl in the industry, how important do you feel it is to stay true to your yourself and show diversity?</strong></p><p>As a young black girl in the entertainment industry, I feel like it’s important for me to use my platform to inspire all audiences especially those who DM me such kind messages on how they can get started in the industry & how they can get their hair into an Afro! I rock my Afro proudly whether I’m on the runway or on set. Diversity is very important to me.</p><p><strong>Who are your major inspirations from the industry? Are there any particular that you wish to work in the future?</strong></p><p>Some of my major inspirations in the industry are Ryan Murphy, Jordan Peele, Lupita, and Meryl Streep. I would love to get the chance to work with Jordan Peele and Ryan Murphy because they make such unique and thought out horror films/ TV&nbsp;series and I would love to play in the department for once.</p><p><strong>Jenasha, you’re a fashionista yourself. Which are your top three favorite fashion brands?</strong></p><p>Wheww!! Girl, that’s a tough question. I think I’d have to say Gucci, Dolce Gabbana, Christian Cowan will be my top three picks.</p><p><strong>How would you define your personal style and yourself combined in three words?</strong></p><p>Extravagant, stylish, fabulous.</p><p><strong>Apart from your career, how else do you contribute to society?</strong></p><p>I love being involved in giving back by participating/volunteering in organizations for children’s hospitals, toy drives and donating clothes. Seeing the smiles on the kids’ faces when you are handing them a toy makes me so happy.</p><p><strong>Great!
