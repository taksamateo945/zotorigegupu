He sat next to my then-husband at a lunch with common acquaintances and they spoke about Hollywood. Because I’m often timid in new social settings, I excused myself and went for a walkabout Park City. Mason, on the other hand, piqued my interest; he was cute and charming. I began following him on Instagram shortly after that meal. I liked his gentle, self-deprecating wit. His intellect just added to his allure. He began to pursue me as well. When he liked a post or commented on anything I’d written, my heart would skip a beat. We had comparable upbringings, having grown up in different countries, ranging from England to Brazil (myself) to Indonesia (him).”</p><h2>Morfit proposed a few months later, and the couple is now engaged.</h2><p>Jordana Brewster’s second wedding happened more than a year after her divorce from film director Andrew Form.
