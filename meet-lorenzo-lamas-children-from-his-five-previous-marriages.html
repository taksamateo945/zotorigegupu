Lorenzo Lamas has been married five times, divorced five times, and blessed with six children, all of whom have had one level of success or the other in their careers.</strong></p><h2><strong>How Many Children Does Lorenzo Lamas Have From His Previous Marriages?</strong></h2><p>Lorenzo Lamas has six children in all, but he had five of them – a son and five daughters – from his wives, including <strong>Alvaro Joshua “AJ,” Shayne, Alexandra Lynne, Victoria Arlene,</strong> and<strong> Isabella Lorenza.</strong></p><p>It is interesting to note that of the five marriages Lorenzo Lamas was involved in, only two of those produced children. And while he has had five kids from two of his wives, Lamas had a daughter with American writer and actress Daphne Lee Ashbrook in 1988 – before he was married the third time.</p><p>The name of his daughter with the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&nbsp;actress is <strong>Paton Lee</strong>. With that, we look at the lives of the six known children born to the Renegade actor Lorenzo Lamas.</p><h2><strong>Who Are Lorenzo Lamas and Michele Cathy Smith’s Children?</strong></h2><p>Michele Cathy Smith was Lorenzo Lamas’ second wife. They had only two children together – a son named Alvaro Joshua “AJ” Lamas and a daughter named Shayne Lamas. In 2018, Lorenzo’s second wife, Michele Cathy, lost her life at the age of 60.</p><h3><strong>1.

However, his father, Lorenzo, still played an essential role in AJ’s upbringing.

AJ seems to be more famous for his controversies than his acting career. Besides this scandal, he has found his name popping up in the media for the wrong things. In 2001, he was accused by his ex-girlfriend, Jessie Schulman, of breaking into her home and holding her captive in her bathroom.</p><p>After the incident, she filed for a restraining order. However, AJ denied ever doing such a thing. In 2012, AJ was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol; after pleading guilty, he was sentenced to 36 months of probation and a fine of $1,600.

It was short as the marriage, which was instituted in 1981, ended just one year later in 1982.

They tied the nuptial knots in 1989. However, it has been said that they had been together for a long time before eventually heading to the altar.</p><p>Their marriage lasted even longer than Lorenzo’s first two marriages, as the pair were together for four years before eventually getting divorced in 1993.

A wedding was planned to take place in 2005, but it was unfortunately called off by Lorenzo Lamas a night before the D-day. It was later revealed that the decision to cancel the wedding was because Barbara had given a male stripper fellatio at her bachelorette party.</p><p>The following year, Lamas was in the dating pool again, and this time he started courting Second Wives Club star, Shawna Craig. And five years later, they headed to the altar. The wedding took place on April 30, 2011, in Mexico, and the marriage lasted for seven years but produced no children.</p><p>However, as is always the case, another Lorenzo Lamas marriage headed for the rocks and ended in June 2018. The cause of divorce was alleged infidelity on the part of Shawna Craig.</p><h3><strong>Lorenzo Lamas’ Sixth Wife Will Have To Inherit Six Children</strong></h3><p>After divorcing his fifth wife, Lorenzo Lamas said he was done with marriage. Everyone believed him because, after five marriages, a man deserves to take a break. But from the looks of things, Lorenzo has met a charming lady with whom he is willing to take the risk of walking down the aisle again.</p><p>The actor is currently in a relationship with an Idaho native, Kenna Nicole Scott, and has already proposed to her (in February 2021).
