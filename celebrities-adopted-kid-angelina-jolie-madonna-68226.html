Sandra Bullock and Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are just some of the stars who have chosen to adopt kids. For someone like Charlize Theron, adoption was always her “first choice” when it came to expanding her family.
“I was always aware that there are so many children in this world who don’t have families,” the Atomic Blonde actress, who is a proud mom to kids Jackson and August, once said on Today."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For someone like <a href=#><strong>Charlize Theron</strong></a>, adoption was always her “first choice” when it came to expanding her family.</p><p>“I was always aware that there are so many children in this world who don’t have families,” the Atomic Blonde actress, who is a <a href=#>proud mom to kids Jackson and August</a>, once said on <a href=#>Today</a>. “Adoption is a very personal thing — I know people whom I love dearly who don’t feel that they could raise another child as their own. I respect that. But for me — and I can’t be the only person out there — I never saw a difference in raising an adopted child versus my own biological child. I don’t feel like I’m missing out on something.”</p><p>In fact, Angelina has also spoken out about the joy of adoption. “All adopted children come with a beautiful mystery of a world that is meeting yours,” she previously told <a href=#>Vogue</a>. “When they are from another race and foreign land, that mystery, that gift, is so full. For them, they must never lose touch with where they came from.”</p><p><a href=#>Angelina shares her adopted children, Pax, Zahara and Maddox, with Brad</a>. The couple are also parents to their three biological kids, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox. Like Angelina, Sandra has learned about the beauty of adoption from raising <a href=#>her two kids, Laila and Louis</a>, with boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Bryan Randall</strong></a>.</p><p>During an interview on Today, the mother of two revealed why being a mom makes her so happy. “I finally realize, ‘Oh this is what I was supposed to do when I grew up,’” she said. “This is my purpose, and I knew it at a very young age … I felt that calling at a very young age, but I had to become the mom that I was supposed to be for the kids that were waiting for me.”</p><p><strong>Click through the gallery below to see Charlize, Angelina, Sandra and more stars who have adopted kids!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8Keo56aop7BqrHSZpidp6CpsqV5yqKbZpmenLKttc2aZKOnnJ6ybrnAnaanppFig3l%2BkW9mqaCfqby0e8KhmKukma%2BybsDHnqmopl2frqS30qilZmlhZYFxgQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
