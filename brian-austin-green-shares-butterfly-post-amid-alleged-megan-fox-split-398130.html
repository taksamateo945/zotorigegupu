The actor insinuated that butterflies have to get off of a flower sometimes to experience the world.</p><p>He stated, “they start feeling smothered.” On the 16th of May, Brian added in his post that it was a “great big world” and butterflies want to enjoy what the world has to offer. People on social media were quick to point out that this could possibly be in reference to his relationship with Megan.</p><p>Several of her fans and followers alluded to the tattoo she purportedly has on her back that says everyone laughs at “gilded butterflies.” As it was previously reported, Megan and Machine Gun Kelly were spotted out in the Calabasas neighborhood of LA earlier this weekend.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CARLhsaHwKD/</p><p>They were driving around in the 30-year-old’s luxury Aston Martin before finally driving back to her house. Fans of the couple know their relationship has been on rocky grounds for many years. For instance, on the 17th of April, Brian was seen out in public without his ring.</p><p>He was seen without it again on the 26th of April in the same neighborhood. Rumors have persisted for months, especially after The Daily Mail reported that Green and Megan have been spending their days apart amid the quarantine.</p><p>Green, for instance, has been staying in Malibu, whereas Megan has been staying in Calabasas. Rumors of their marital problems first picked up a few years ago in 2015, when Megan filed for divorce that year but they later rescinded those very same documents the following year.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>During a conversation with Extra reporters in 2017, Megan said that she and Green didn’t have any plans to have more kids. Megan joked that her body probably can’t handle having anymore either.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSp7aiuoyarKysmaN6qL7EnqVmq5iWv6a%2FjJusrayVp7OtxYyppqysXZa6qrCMmqOlnZeasW65xKCYp2WWpMVuv8%2BloK1lY26Fcn%2BPaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
