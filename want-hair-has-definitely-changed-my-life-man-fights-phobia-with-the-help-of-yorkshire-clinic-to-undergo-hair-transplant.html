Always seek independent medical advice and give the procedure careful consideration before going ahead. And r</b><b id=docs-internal-guid-72035647-7fff-2b0b-1159-ebfa89fd17da>esults may vary depending on the age and health of the person.</b></b></b></i></p><p>Adam said: “I had a big fear of going bald, so I started looking into things (hair transplant procedures) but I also had a fear of needles, so I was torn between two phobias. I stumbled across Want Hair on social media, a guy on there promoted Want Hair because he got a second transplant with them because his first one went wrong.”</p><p>After seeing impressive results and testimonies on social media, Adam was inspired to pay the clinic a visit to see what that they could do for him. He said: “I came up and spoke to Anthony and Shammy and I felt really really confident straight away that this was the organisation I wanted to go through.</p><p>“It’s the way they relax you, they don’t lie to you, they tell you exactly how it’s going to be. I never felt pressured at any point in time, they’ve never chased me, they left the decision in my hands and that’s a big selling point to me. They let me make the decision rather than pushing me towards using Want Hair.</p><p>“The first consultation I had here with Anthony, he put me under the microscope, he showcased exactly what the procedure will give me in terms of hair quality, thickness, the amount of grafts I would potentially need, but more than anything it was the aftercare that they kept speaking about – that they were going to look after me.”</p><p>He explained: “The ethos that they have of you take your time, we’ll tell you the information that you need, and we’ll showcase exactly what’s going to happen within the process.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.examinerlive.co.uk/incoming/article24196182.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_03170MTS00_00_15_15Still002.jpg><p>During Adam’s consultation with Anthony, they explored different locations for Adam’s potential procedure to take place, and discussed where he might feel most comfortable undergoing surgery. Want Hair have connections with hospitals worldwide, but Adam decided on a clinic down in London.</p><p>He said: “When the day of reckoning came, I was really nervous, but as soon as I got there I sat down and they spoke to me about the procedure. They explained that I was going to be there for seven or eight hours. They explained about the first three or four hours, then the second three or four hours, the lunch break, how I might be feeling all the way through. They explained how many anaesthetic needles they had and they were totally honest with me – that’s what I liked about it. At any one time there were around three or four people in the room, so I felt really comfortable that this is a professional outfit, these are people who actually want to make me feel good during the procedure.”</p><p>The high level of care continued long after the procedure was completed, Adam said: “The after care is five out of five, and I can’t stress this enough. They even set up a WhatsApp group where someone was available every single day for the first two weeks. I could send pictures through at any time, day or night, if I had any questions or queries I could message that group and they’d get back to me literally within five minutes. They were always ringing me, always checking in on me, always giving me feedback especially when I was really nervous.”</p><p>Adam was grateful to have continuous access to professionals willing to guide him through each step of the way, helping to manage the anxious feelings he was experiencing. He told us: “Although they explain what’s going to happen in the first two to three weeks, it’s a really scary time and I was actually really anxious, especially when I had to do the first proper wash.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.examinerlive.co.uk/incoming/article24196186.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Consulatuion-1.jpg><p>“Everything they’ve advised me has been spot on; when my hairs are going to drop back out again then regrow, what pains I might experience, any numbness.</p><p>“They’ve been totally honest and totally transparent with me all the way through. They’ve taken every single thing on board that I’ve ever asked for or put forward to them, and I’ve never once felt any regret for choosing Want Hair over the other few consultations that I had.</p><p>“Want Hair has definitely changed my life. I can see the difference in my hairline already, and the thickness is starting to come back, and that’s only three or four weeks after the procedure. Any treatment I ever choose in the future, I’d probably actually go with Want Hair as well, because obviously they do different products and services so you never know.</p><p>“They’ve made me feel like I’ve accomplished something. I genuinely never thought I would get away from my needle phobias, and I’ve done it.”</p><p>The founder and CEO of Want Hair, Shammy Israil, 46, from Leeds, shared the reason behind founding Want Hair nine years ago, and why they go that extra mile to make sure their patients feel supported.</p><p>He said: “The motivating factor for me opening this company a number of years ago is that I went through hair loss myself at an early age, and therefore I spent a good part of 18 months looking into different treatments and different surgeries, not just in the UK but all over the world.</p><p>“Ultimately though, surgery in the UK is quite expensive, so my main goal has always been to be able to provide hair transplant surgery at <span>a price that may be</span> affordable to the average person on the street and whilst doing that, we don’t have to diminish the service levels and quality of surgery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.examinerlive.co.uk/incoming/article24196184.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_03176MTS00_00_45_07Still001.jpg><p>“So far we have done that, we feel we<i style=font-weight:700> </i>have got a good reputation. We carry out surgery in the UK and with partner hospitals worldwide, and we are one of the highest rated companies on Trustpilot and Google,” he continued.</p><p>“One of the things that we take pride in is that when you come in as a client to us, from the start point to the end point, you only deal with one person. That means that the consultant who has spoken to you from ‘day dot’ will be with you throughout your journey, from before you book in, during your assessment, during your surgery and will continue to be on hand post surgery up until 12 months or more. We don’t work 9-5, it’s not a Monday to Friday service, the patient coordinator, who is with you throughout your journey, is accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p><p>“This is why all our clients feel really happy with the after care service, because no matter how big or small your question is, and no matter what time of the day it is, there is always somebody on hand to be able to help you and give you that comfort to help you along.</p><p><span>“After getting in contact with us, one of the consultants in the team will give you a call or contact you via email and they’ll arrange a time for you to have a consultation with them. Our consultations are not a five or ten minute quick session; they’re usually from around 30 minutes to an hour depending on the situation. The consultant will go through your personal situation in great detail. They’ll talk you through hair loss treatments and the hair transplant surgery if its something that’s available to yourself </span><span>and if it is assessed as suitable for you following your consultation.</span></p><p>“Our consultations are very thorough, nothing is rushed, and we are here to answer any questions you’ve got, but its not only about answering your questions, we want you to walk away understanding all the underlying issues, the one thing we try to stress to the customer is; a hair transplant surgery is not something like a miracle cure, you need to understand the pros and cons, but once you have the information to hand you can make an informed decision. After the consultation, you won’t hear from us again, we’ll wait for you to contact us.</p><p>“If you’ve got any further enquiries you want to make, please get in touch with us by giving us a call, we do have a dedicated line which is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week so there should be someone there to arrange a consultation with you there and then.”</p><p><b>The price for a hair transplant at Want Hair is £2,499, which includes Follicular Unit Extraction Hair Transplant, </b><b>Pre and Post Op Support and </b><b>Post Op Medication.
