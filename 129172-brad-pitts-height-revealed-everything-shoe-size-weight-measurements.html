He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was born on</a> 18th December 1963 to William Alvin Pitt and Jane Etta in Shawnee, Oklahoma. His father was the proprietor of a trucking company, while his mother worked as a school counsellor. Shortly after his birth, his parents relocated to Springfield, Missouri, together with his siblings: Douglas Mitchell and Julie Neal.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> Never miss breaking news – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">join</a> Briefly News' Telegram channel!</p><p class=align-left>Pitt went to the Kickapoo High School before being admitted to the University of Missouri in 1982, where he <a href=#>studied journalism</a> with a focus on advertising. As a high school student, he partook in swimming, golf, and tennis. He was also in the Key and Forensics clubs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/dec58c89b84333f6.jpg><p class=align-left>Nevertheless, while in the university, his passion for acting became more pronounced. So, shortly before he finished, he decided to explore it. Eventually, he left <a href=#>the university</a> a few weeks before graduation and moved to Los Angeles, where he was trained in acting while working odd jobs.</p><h2>Is Brad Pitt actually short?</h2><p class=align-left>It is not exactly known whether he is tall or short. Nevertheless, most people consider him slightly above men's average height, which is 5 feet and 9 inches. If the body mass index is anything to go by, Brad Pitt's height and weight ratio appears to be in order.</p><h3>How tall is Brad Pitt?</h3><p class=align-left>And what does he weigh now? The successful actor is 5 feet and 11 inches tall, weighing approximately 78 kilograms.</p><p class=align-left>Most people would not have worried about his height, but when he was named <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sexiest Man Alive</a> in 1995 and 2000, critics felt he was not tall enough to be considered for that title. Nevertheless, it would be hearsay to disparage the aura possessed by Brad Pitt <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">in his prime</a>. The man climbed to the top of the movie industry with his energetic and skilful acting on movie sets.</p><h2>What is Brad Pitt's height and weight?</h2><p class=align-left>Brad Pitt's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">height and weight</a> discussion is inconclusive because while some claim that he is almost 6 feet tall, others posit that he is 6 feet tall. One of the reasons for this disparity is that the actor has sometimes given an outstanding posture about himself. In fact, in his prime, the actor reportedly could not be caught slouching.</p><p class=align-left>However, he was sometimes noticed wearing shoes that made him appear taller than his colleagues. Brad Pitt barefoot would be <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">about an inch below</a> 6 feet tall, according to some sources online who put his height at 5 feet and 11 inches.</p><h2>Is Leonardo DiCaprio taller than Brad?</h2><p class=align-left>It is almost impossible to tell who is taller between the two. Although Leonardo DiCaprio is reportedly 6 feet, Brad's exact height is uncertain. Nevertheless, according to the <a href=#>Celebrity</a>.FM, considering their heights in the movie, <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>, where they acted together, Leonardo Dicaprio is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a small inch taller</a> than Brad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/50ae174181b59545.jpg><h2>Brad Pitt's shoe size</h2><p class=align-left>Brad <a id=https://celebrityinside.com/body-measurements/actor/brad-pitt-body-measurements-height-weight-chest-waist-shoe-size-bio/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wears a size nine</a>, according to Celebrity Inside's website, and this seems a bit smaller for a man of his height. However, according to Healthline, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">average shoe size</a> who are between 5' 10" to 6' 2" tall is 11 to 12.5.</p><p class=align-left>Brad Pitt's height may be a subject of disparity, but one sure thing is that the actor has reached an enviable height in the movie industry. His net worth is at least $300 million, and from the look of things, he is not looking to hang up his shoes anytime soon.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Who is Denise Milani?
