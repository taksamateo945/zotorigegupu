The Chicago-based burger giant, which has about 13,000 franchise operators in the United States, recently circulated an internal memo that outlined several major shifts in its relationship with long-standing franchisees, according to Restaurant Business. And while you can bet these updates will likely amount to a better, more consistent customer experience, the news isn’t so positive for McDonald’s operators."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When children or spouses of existing operators apply to become operators themselves, they will be evaluated as new candidates without preferential treatment.</p><p>As an advocate for innovation and growth, Erlinger’s goal is to clean house and attract a more diverse pool of franchisees to the McDonald’s brand.</p><p>But with sales and foot traffic at an all-time high, existing franchisees see these changes as an “overreach,” according to Restaurant Business. The new policies are likely to prompt a further exodus of long-term operators—last year, the chain saw a record number of its restaurants change ownership as a significant number of franchisees left the system.<span aria-hidden=true>6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e</span></p><p>But the pruning may be just what McDonald’s is after. “Everything, or should I say everyone, we need to build the future of McDonald’s isn’t in this room today. We must attract the right people and we will do that together,” Erlinger said to employees, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82uq6uhpJ68r3vMnJuoppGhsbR5yKxkppmbnruoecyaoaiqXZ67tbHRp5ilZZOdrq%2BzxKxkraCRqXq4tculZKKloJawtXnToZxmr5GueqrAjKinnqqRqbK0ecSaq2asmJ7AbrrOrWStoJGpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
