Vocalist/guitarist Evan Bailey explains, “‘MEG/\DETH TEE’ is a record about childhood trauma, but also about every experience you carry with you; painful and joyous. What do you keep with you and what do you throw away?”
Produced by Grammy-nominated Jack Shirley (Deafheaven, Oathbreaker, Gouge Away), both “Rushing Lattice and the upcoming album are deeply personal and reflective, exploring the depths and memories of childhood."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The lyrics for the track were written by artist David Mohr as long-form prose poetry and further adapted into shorter lyric form.</p><p>In her summation of the album, Linda Sao wrote, “Needless to say, the entire recording is beautiful, energizing, and easy to keep on loop. You have this way of making heavy and dark songs still catchy and fun — and that’s something I think is really difficult to do well. The production, your own song swells, and the background vox are pro, as expected, but — again — it’s your song lyrics that kill me every time….Your lyrics are always just so moving: “real” or “raw” or “cutting” come to my mind when I think of how to describe them…I don’t know if they’re autobiographical and always from a place of life reflection ..or if you write creative fictional narratives, but your songs are gut-wrenching”</p><p>“Rushing Lattice” opens on a tight, tatty rhythm topped by deliciously grubby guitars. Bailey’s wistful, evocative vocals imbue the lyrics with hints of melancholy, giving the tune brooding savors. The feel and flow of the harmonics capture visceral textures, at once dirty and unexpectedly alluring.</p><p>The beautiful, iterative outro features shimmers of color, creamy and lustrous with soft textures as if contemplating the emotional sway of what was.</p><p>Oh Lonesome Ana has it going on! “Rushing Lattice” is simultaneously raw yet elegant, offering a search for understanding and relief from the past.</p><p>Follow Oh Lonesome Ana <a href=#>Instagram</a> | <a href=#>Twitter</a> | <a href=#>Facebook</a> | <a href=#>YouTube</a> | <a href=#>Spotify</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kvKl5y6ilnquforJurc2aZKudnJqutLHSZqWer12otq%2Bzy55kpq2jnrBuwsidnKhloqrAqbXNoGSlmaSptqSxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
