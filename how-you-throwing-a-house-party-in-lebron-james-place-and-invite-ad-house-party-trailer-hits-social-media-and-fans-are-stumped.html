The nearly two-and-a-half-minute teaser video is packed with treats, including several A-list celebrity cameos from the likes of Snoop Dogg, Lena Waithe, Kid Cudi, Lil Wayne and a teammate of LeBron’s, Anthony Davis.</p><p>There is even a hologram of LeBron that gives him daily compliments such as telling him he handled the decision to join the Miami Heat in 2010 “perfectly.”</p><p>However, reactions from viewers on social media weren’t as positive. Folks quickly took to social media, sharing their thoughts on the naughty remake. “Space Jam 2 and now helping fund that terrible looking House Party,” wrote one displeased critic. “LeBron James might be my enemy.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Space Jam 2 and now helping fund that terrible looking House Party.
