This new sound showcases Nicholas’ continued mature musical sound, after his finishing in the runner-up position on the 2013 series of ‘The X Factor.’</p><p>When he appeared on ‘The X Factor,’ he was mentored by Louis Walsh and over the weeks, the nation watched as he grew in confidence as the competition progressed, along with his vocals continually impressing both the Judges and viewers.</p><p></p><p>Following his time on the show, he went on to release his debut single ‘Answerphone,’ closely followed by his debut album ‘In The Arms Of An Angel,’ which mainly comprised of covers of popular tracks. The album peaked at number six in the UK Albums Chart.</p><p></p><p>He has embarked on a headline tour around the UK and Ireland, along with headlining many events over the years.</p><p>The first hint of new music from Nicholas McDonald came from his appearance on ‘Loose Women’ alongside 2013 ‘The X Factor’ winner Sam Bailey, with him going on to say that he was in the process of working on his second album independently.</p><p></p><p>We can’t wait to hear the new single from Nicholas McDonald and hopefully more original new music in the coming months!</p><p>‘LimeLight’ is set to be released on Friday 23 November 2018.</p><h4>&nbsp;Are you looking forward to hearing ‘LimeLight’ as much as we are here at CelebMix?
