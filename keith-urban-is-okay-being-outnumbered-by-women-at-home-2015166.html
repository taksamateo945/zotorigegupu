After all, the American Idol judge tells <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> he never stops learning from his three leading ladies: wife <a href=#><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a>, and daughters Sunday and Faith.</p><p>"I didn't grow up with any girls in my family, it was just my brother and me and mum and dad," Urban, 47, told reporters at Nashville's CMA Music Festival on June 14. "Now being in a family that is all girls, I'm learning an enormous amount."</p><p>Married in 2006, Urban and Kidman, 47, have found their parenting styles mesh as their relationship evolved. "Nic and I are very in sync with the way we want to raise our girls," said Urban, who married Kidman after less than one month together. "[We maintain] a very expressive, artistic house. I'm very comfortable with it."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Urban has especially noticed how their eldest daughter, Sunday, who turns 7 years old on July 7, has blossomed in recent months. "Nic and I were just talking about [how] she’s just transformed in this little period, the last handful of months. She's a [growing] girl!"</p><p>The musician is quick to praise his wife's efforts, but Kidman herself says Urban is the rock in their marriage. In an <a href=#>October 2014 interview</a> with <a href=#><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a>, Kidman said her man showed his true colors when Kidman was grieving the sudden death of her father. 'He's amazing," Kidman gushed of her hubby. "We all go through terrible things at different times in our lives, but to be literally carried by your partner, physically at times 'cause I was so devastated, it's just like, I'll do anything for that man."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKeoaSdera%2BwZqlZqGjYrysrdhmmZ6hnpx6sMHTp6ymmpWnsqV5wbJksKedmrturdNmn6illWJ%2FcX2Uam1v</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
