Unraveling the Movies Shooting Locations</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-04-12</div><p>The 2019 action thriller “Trauma Centre,” directed by Matt Eskandari, stars Nicky Whelan as Madison Taylor, a young lady who finds herself in the crossfire of two crooked police officers in a shadowy alleyway. She discovers she was a witness to their crime after she awakens in a hospital, and Lieutenant Steve Wakes is assigned to look out for her. Madison is confined in a locked-down hospital when the two dishonest police officers arrive to get rid of her. She then has to attempt to get from them.</p><p>During the terrible night, Madison desperately calls for Wakes’ assistance but has little chance of escaping the hospital alive. The plot of the film, which primarily takes place in the hospital’s hallways and corridors, also features Bruce Willis, Tito Ortiz, Texas Battle, and Lynn Gilmartin in addition to Whelan. This prompts the viewer to wonder, “Where was ‘Trauma Centre’ shot?” We have the data necessary to respond to your query, then!</p><h3>Trauma Center Filming Locations</h3><p>Filming for “Trauma Centre” took place in Florida and Puerto Rico, particularly in the San Juan Metropolitan Area and possibly Miami. Principal photography reportedly began on the thriller film in March 2019 and was completed by the end of the same month. Without further ado, allow us to take you to each unique location that can be found in the Bruce Willis movie.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Nicky Whelan (@nickywhelan)</a></p><h3>San Juan Metropolitan Area, Puerto Rico</h3><p>The San Juan Metropolitan Area, a designated Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) centred around the titular city, served as the shooting location for a major portion of “Trauma Centre.” The majority of the film was shot in San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States. According to reports, the production crew appeared to use one of the city’s film studios while setting up camp in other neighbourhoods and streets to shoot numerous outside sequences against appropriate backdrops.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Matt Eskandari (@matteskandari)</a></p><p>La Mila de Oro, Ocean Park Beach, the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Centre, the Museum of Art of Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art, and the San Juan Wildlife Museum are just a few of the well-known structures and sites that may be seen in the background of various scenes. The ‘Trauma Centre’ film crew also made the most of the locations in Bayamón, a city, municipality, and suburb of San Juan, for shooting.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Matt Eskandari (@matteskandari)</a></p><p>Nicky Whelan, who plays Bruce Willis’ leading woman Madison Taylor, spoke about her experience filming the movie in an interview with The Morning Show from October 2019. It’s quite terrible, she said. I inhaled deeply as I read it since I wasn’t sure how I would manage the pandemonium for a month. It was pretty gruelling in this hospital in Puerto Rico because it was a night shoot.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Matt Eskandari (@matteskandari)</a></p><p>Whelan said, “We’d start working at five in the evening and finish at five in the morning, and all night I’d be covered in blood, yelling and sobbing, and being hounded. It is upsetting. I was in bed all day. In Puerto Rico, I was never able to see the sun. It was fairly intense. However, I did prepare for it.</p><h3>Miami, Florida</h3><p>There is evidence that more of “Trauma Centre” was taped in Miami. The filmmaking crew undoubtedly took advantage of the city’s varied locations to capture a few crucial scenes for the movie. In addition to “Trauma Centre,” Miami has served as the location for the filming of several other motion pictures and television shows, including “XXX: Return of Xander Cage,” “Thunderball,” “Transporter 2,” “The Specialist,” and “Speed Kills.”</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c9c5dc8e24ec8d74ae07e882d4c2212b?s=150&d=mp&r=g" height=150 width=150 itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Ayushi S</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><ul><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best Chick Flicks on HBO Max Right Now: Your Guide to Romantic Movie Nights</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Vanessa Papa The Ultimatum: A Recap of the Drama-Unfolding Reality Show</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best Indian Shows on Netflix: Exploring Rich and Diverse Cultural Narratives</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best PG-13 Movies on Netflix: Family-Friendly Entertainment for Various Tastes</span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmicn6mwsLnSraaroZWoe6S7zGirq5mloq5ur8Snq56qXZu2rbnEnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
