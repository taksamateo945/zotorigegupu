The <a href=# rel=noopener>lyrics</a> appear to be a wistful love letter to a former flame at first, but as the song progresses, turns out to be the singer’s love letter to herself. Let’s look at the first verses that lead to the chorus:&nbsp;</p><p>We were good, we were gold<br>Kinda dream that can’t be sold<br>We were right ’til we weren’t<br>Built a home and watched it burn</p><p>Mm, I didn’t wanna leave you<br>I didn’t wanna lie<br>Started to cry but then remembered I</p><p>I can buy myself flowers<br>Write my name in the sand<br>Talk to myself for hours<br>Say things you don’t understand<br>I can take myself dancing<br>And I can hold my own hand<br>Yeah, I can love me better than you can</p><p>Fans and onlookers took notice of some phrases in the first verse, particularly those that seem to allude to Miley and Liam when they were a couple:</p><p>We were good, we were gold<br>Kinda dream that can’t be sold</p><p>They were certainly an “it couple” of sorts during the course of their relationship, with Miley being a world-famous pop star and Liam a rising leading man in Hollywood. They were truly “gold.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Not much digging is needed to connect the dots when one gets to the next following lines, which allude to their eventual separation as well as <a href=# rel=noopener>their home burning down in 2018</a> from a California wildfire:</p><p>We were right ’til we weren’t<br>Built a home and watched it burn</p><p>In the second verse, Miley seems to be singing about one of the problems that plagued their relationship: <a href=# rel=noopener>Liam’s disapproval</a> of some of Miley’s behavior and choices. She uses red nail polish as an analogy to carry the message across:</p><p>Paint my nails, cherry red<br>Match the roses that you left<br>No remorse, no regret<br>I forgive every word you said</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Liam and Miley: A brief timeline&nbsp;</h2><p>Miley Cyrus and <a href=#>Liam Hemsworth</a>‘s relationship lasted a long time – 10 years – but it was riddled with problems throughout. Although the love was real between them, <a href=# rel=noopener>they broke up and made up</a> quite frequently within that period of time. They finally decided to make things official between them in 2018, confirming wedding rumors in December of that year.&nbsp;</p><p>Things, however, did not seem to work out well in the <a href=#>Hemsworth-Cyrus union</a> that by August 2019, it was officially announced by both parties that they were separating. Before the year ended, their divorce was finalized and by February 2020, Liam and Miley were legally single.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The lyrics are not the only telling thing about “Flowers,” Miley Cyrus’ latest hit. People all over the internet have been commenting about the music video for the song as well, pointing out some details to be <a href=# rel=noopener>Easter eggs</a> from Miley’s relationship with Liam. Watch the video below and see if you can spot the clues.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>An anthem for self-love</h2><p>Shade or no shade, Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” sounds more like an empowering song about finding self-love after a traumatic experience such as divorce. The verses can simply be interpreted as a backdrop, a quick reference to where the singer came from before arriving at the conclusion that everything she sought from another person she could find in herself.&nbsp;</p><p>With today’s emphasis on self-care and embracing one’s own unique needs, “Flowers” perfectly captures one’s journey to finding true happiness and satisfaction by going inward rather than in the opposite direction.</p><p>I can buy myself flowers<br>Write my name in the sand<br>Talk to myself for hours<br>Say things you don’t understand<br>I can take myself dancing<br>And I can hold my own hand<br>Yeah, I can love me better than you can</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@mileycyrus href=# rel=noopener>@mileycyrus</a><p>Celebrating “Flowers” being <a title=1 href=# rel=noopener>#1</a> around the world again this week!&nbsp;I love that this record is connecting in such a positive way & it’s a pleasure to continue creating music for you.
