Luksich and James Kelly Dating Timeline and Relationships</h2><p><strong>James Kelly and Lily A. Luksich</strong> have been dating for quite some time. However, there are no specifics regarding when they started dating.&nbsp;Both of their names rose to attention in the media after the horrific shooting in which both of them were wounded. Kelly shot Lily, then Kelly was shot by the police officer.&nbsp;In addition, James and Lily attended the music festival together. They set up a tent camp at the Gorge campsite, and in the evening, James ate some mushrooms and strolled over to the music venue with Lily. While the couple was at the musical venue, James began to feel the effects of the mushroom dosage and began having hallucinations.</p><p>Kelly, according to Lily, began to feel that the world was ending and that he needed to return to his camp right away with his fiancée. After that, they went to the campground, and Kelly made many assertions about how this would affect them in the end.&nbsp;Kelly returned to his pickup truck and got his weapon from a secured box in the center console when they arrived back at the camp. He walked out from behind the driver’s door after loading a magazine into the revolver and chambering a round.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lily-A.-Luksich-2.jpg alt="Lily A.
