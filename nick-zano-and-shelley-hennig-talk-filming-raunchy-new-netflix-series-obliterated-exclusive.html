Thomas Howell, Kimi Rutledge, Paola Lázaro, Terrence Terrell, Alyson Gorske</strong>, and <strong>Eugene Kim</strong> star in the eight-episode inaugural season, which is currently in the No. 3 spot for trending TV shows on the streaming giant as of today (December 11). And while Hennig and Zano tell Celeb Secrets that you should&nbsp;<span>not</span> kick back and watch this exhilarating R-rated series with your family, it’s still something you should check out for a good laugh.</p><p>“When you’re reading the scripts, you’re like, and then this happens. When we’re filming, we’d look at the call sheet, be like, okay, today there’s sex in front of a camel, but then we’re in harnesses climbing elevator shafts for seven hours,” Shelley tells <strong>Celeb Secrets</strong> host <strong>Juliet Schroder</strong> exclusively during a virtual junket. “It is action packed, which made it really fun. The show definitely reflects that.”</p><p>“It’s raunchy and violent, but actually has a lot of heart,” Nick adds. “The heart sneaks in there for sure.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OBLITERATED_107_Unit_03520RC-1024x683.jpg><p>Filming in both Las Vegas and Albuquerque, New Mexico, both actors reveal that they had an absolute blast getting into character and working with such a talented cast and crew.</p><p>“It was like a dream, you know?” Nick says of playing Chad McKnight, who is Ava’s SEAL team leader. “When I was a kid, I always wanted to be a Navy Seal, and part of my life I thought I actually was. That was my end game for myself. So getting to hang out with our tech advisor, Kevin Kent, doing all of our gun training was just like living like a little boy’s dream. It was epic.”</p><p>“What I loved about this show was that it felt like a talent show for every single one of us,” Hennig, who plays Ava Winters, a CIA agent who co-leads a special forces group investigating a nuclear threat in Las Vegas, adds. “The creators of the show asked so much of each and every one of us, and as actors, that’s not always the case. It’s fun to be asked to do the million things that we had to do, including the, you know, tactical training.”</p><p>“The physical aspect of the show was really intense and really fun to do. There’s a scene where we’re crying and then we have to have sex in front of a camel. So, you know, they really asked us to go there and you couldn’t hold back. The commitment was really, really fun,” she continues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OBLITERATED_Unit_02947RC-1024x683.jpg><p>For more on&nbsp;Obliterated,&nbsp;watch our full interview with Nick and Shelley below.
