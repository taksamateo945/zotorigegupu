Blige with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the BET Awards on Sunday night, she had this to say: “I think in any situation where something as devastating as what’s happening in America right now with the immigrants you have to be as loud as you can, and you have to raise as much awareness.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BzBh398nybI/</p><p>She went on to say: “As a nation, put all your heads together and put your voices together and be as loud as possible because that’s the only way politicians in the government actually listen when they feel like their country is as concerned as the matter is concerning. Put your voices together and be as loud as possible.”</p><p>The singer and actress went on to add: “Wherever I go, except for Barbados, I’m an immigrant. I think people forget that a lot of times. I think they see Rihanna the brand. But I think it’s important for people to remember, if you love me, everyone out here is just like me. A million Rihanna’s out there, getting treated like dirt.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"Put your voices together and be as loud as possible."</p><p>With the threat of nationwide deportation raids looming, <a href=# rel=nofollow>@rihanna</a> says we need to stand in solidarity and speak up for our immigrant brothers and sisters in the US. <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/WaTWzpXaFj</a></p><p>— The Root (@TheRoot) <a href=# rel=nofollow>June 24, 2019</a></p><p>The topic inspired a debate, with one person saying: “This is what’s been making America Great! Dedicated and inspiring individuals. How did you figure that, not an immigrant?? I had a green card for years, and it could’ve been taken away at any moment, even tho my mother is an American citizen. Do your research a lil better before you make a fool out yourself.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BzJ5BLmHILN/</p><p>Another commenter shared: “Who is to say what is stolen and what is not. None of us were here to see. Maybe Indians stole it from somewhere else. All we must do is follow the current laws. Therefore they are illegal. If you go to their country without following their laws, they will arrest your bumboclaat.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BzBiOGrHaEv/</p><p>This follower explained: “If you are born in a foreign country other than the US, then you need to legally obtain a visa to America. Once in the country based on how the visa was obtained and granted( visitors, spousal student working, etc.), you gain certain privileges; however, you are not a lawful resident of the US. But you have entered the country legally. From a Visa granted entry in the US, you can move on to gain permanent residency noncitizen in the US. After Residency is given, you have a certain amount of years to live in the US to prove yourself and apply for citizenship. Some people that are citizens can apply to get their families members who are non us residents/aliens residency to the US (chain immigration). A person residing in the US with a legal visa is allowed to travel back and forth to their country with some restrictions.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Trump and Rihanna will never agree on immigration.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinrWius2aZKudo6W8r7DSZquoZaCnsrS1w56lrWWUpLuiuMNmq6utnaXAbq%2FOp6urp6aav7S1wKVkqaSRo8BuwM5mqqmkmal6p63MoqOinaNif3qCkWpsaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
