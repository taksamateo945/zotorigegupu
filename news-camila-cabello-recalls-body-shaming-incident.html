In a new interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Bustle</span></a><span>, the Havana singer opened up about her insecurities, how she felt after her body was the subject of internet trolls, and how she manages her mental health.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Camila revealed that her boyfriend, Shawn Mendes, once sacrificed sleep because he was insecure that if didn't stay in perfect shape he would lose his fans. "I certainly feel obsessive, [like] I need to go to the gym, I need to do this, I need to lose weight quickly. I've felt like that. That's the societal voice in your head," Camila said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Camila has suffered multiple rounds of body shaming, once after a day at the beach with her boyfriend and another when she was snapped going for a jog in New York City. "Being at war with your body is so last season," she told the publication, revealing that she "stumbled" upon the backlash on social media during the first incident. "'This hurts so bad,'" she remembers thinking. "The whole day I felt insecure. I felt like it was changing how I was thinking about food and eating… really messing me up."&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>After the next, she opted to address it head on in a TikTok video. "I actually felt so liberated when I posted that. After that, I went to the airport and so many women were coming up to me like, 'I saw that TikTok and it resonated with me so much,'" she said. "I actually feel my body insecurities went down after I posted that because I was like, 'No matter what pictures come out or what people say, I'm now controlling the narrative.'"</span></p><p><span>Now, she aspires for a balanced life. "You can work out a few hours a day and never eat carbs and whatever, but that's just not a balanced life. That's not what I want… I can't change to fit that mold."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She also opened up about her "toxic stress for years" and how it impacted her mental health. "OCD and anxiety was really hard for me," she explained. "So many times, I was like, 'There must be something wrong with me. I must be inadequate in some way, because just functioning is hard for me right now.'"&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She maintains that having healthy people surrounding her kept her from harm. "Having somebody that's real, that's not ever going to let you get out of line, has been so important to me. I think that's why I never really got lost in the industry. I had challenges with my mental health, but I was never lost."
