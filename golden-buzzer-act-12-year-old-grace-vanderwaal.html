That’s what Grace VanderWaal replied when Simon Cowell asked her if she could win America’s Got Talent. Excited and nervous at the same time, the 12-year-old contestant introduced herself to the judges and the audience. She told the judges that she would sing an original called “I Don’t Know My Name”, a risky step that surprised them. But as Muhammad Ali once said, He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Excited and nervous at the same time, the 12-year-old contestant introduced herself to the judges and the audience. She told the judges that she would sing an original called “I Don’t Know My Name”, a risky step that surprised them. But as Muhammad Ali once said, <i>He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.</i></p><p>The song VanderWaal&nbsp;performed was her own song which she not only wrote but also composed. It was, as she said, ‘about herself’. The moment she started singing, her voice and the lyrics immediately impressed the audience as well as the judges, who gave her a standing ovation. The lyrics which began with<strong> “I don’t know my name, I don’t play by the rules”</strong> ended with <strong>“I now know my name and I don’t play by the rules”</strong>.</p><p>The well-constructed song with the deep meaning behind it would amaze anyone considering how young Grace is.</p><p>As Howie said, the fact that people close to her don’t know that she can sing is ‘so right and so wrong’. But she is a miracle that was bound to happen. Not only did Howie press the Golden Buzzer, he went on stage to hug Grace, something unexpected from him. Check out her performance below:</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNxO9MpQ2vA</p><p>When the host Nick Canon asked her how was she feeling after such amazing response from the panel and the audience, with tears rolling down her eyes, Grace replied,</p><h4>“It’s like , I am kind of daydreaming and I am getting ready to wake up”.</h4><p>To her, it was literally a dream which became more evident&nbsp;as she was constantly turning her head at the time of leaving the stage to see how happy she made the judges and the awed audience.</p><p>This girl is definitely talented and deserves all the attention and love from the world. We wish her luck for her future performances.</p><p>What do you think about Grace’s performance?
