There was a time, not that long ago, when you couldn't mention <strong><a href=#>Jon Gosselin</a></strong> without also mentioning his then-wife, <strong><a href=#>Kate Gosselin</a></strong>. They were a unit — Jon and Kate, plus their eight young children. These days, though, the two lead completely separate lives.&nbsp;</p><p>In a new interview with Entertainment Tonight's Brooke Anderson, Gosselin opens up about the nature of his interactions, or lack thereof, with his now-ex-wife. (The former couple finalized their divorce in 2009 after 10 years of marriage.)</p><p>"I don't have a relationship with Kate. There is no relationship. Text and email. That's it," Gosselin told Anderson, noting that it's been that way for four years. The two don't even cross paths when Gosselin goes to pick up their children. "The nanny comes out and I exchange the kids at her gate or at the bus stop," he explained. "I don't physically see her."&nbsp;</p><p>Gosselin also noted that he does not pay any type of child support to his ex. "[Kate and I] both support [the children] financially because she takes care of school and all that stuff, but I take care of the exact same things she takes care of," he said. "I buy their own groceries. They have their own groceries at my house, their own bedrooms, their own stuff. It's doubled."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As previously reported, Gosselin now lives in a cabin in the woods with no TV or internet. "I've hit rock bottom like 20 times, and then I just bounce back and go somewhere else," he told Anderson.</p><p>After his family's TLC reality show came to an end in 2011, the one-time Jon & Kate Plus 8 star struggled to find work. These days, he's waiting tables at Black Dog restaurant in Beckersville, Pa.</p><p>"At first I was nervous because I was like, 'How are people going to react?'" Gosselin, 36, said of taking the job. "But then I'm thinking, 'Well it's fun and I get to talk to people.' And they technically already know me…They're like, 'Are you the guy?' I'm like, 'Yeah, I'm the guy.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGopl2cvLS%2FxKWgp2Wjlsa0eceeZJ2nlai7tXnPmrBmm5ieuaV50q6nqaeiqXqprdJmpahlopq5osDIqKWsoJmleri106FknrBdrLansYykmK2dXZy8tL%2FEpaCnZWJlfnR9mHI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
