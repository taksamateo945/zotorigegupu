How far would you be willing to go to see your favourite artist live? On March 3rd, the line of eager Hoodie Allen fans stretched down the street in sub-zero temperature to see him play a show at the Danforth Music Hall. Was the wait in the cold worth it? CelebMix was there, and we say that the answer is YES!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

On March 3rd,&nbsp;the line of eager Hoodie Allen fans stretched down the street in sub-zero temperature to see him play a show at the Danforth Music Hall. Was the wait in the cold&nbsp;worth it? CelebMix was there, and we say that the answer is YES!</p><p>The experience began even before the first opening act&nbsp;stepped onstage. Upon&nbsp;entering the venue, Hoodie himself was standing at the merch booth, selling hats, bandanas, and tops to fans with members of the touring band!</p><p>Speaking of opening acts,&nbsp;since Blackbear&nbsp;announced that he would no longer be joining Hoodie and Kyle on tour, we were left wondering: Who would take his place? Bryce Vine couldn’t make it to Toronto, so that just added to the curiosity. Despite this, everyone was still buzzing with excitement. Who could Hoodie have invited onstage?&nbsp;<a href=#>Ed Sheeran joined him in Los Angeles</a>, and Toronto is one of many cities&nbsp;filled with talented musicians.</p><p>Toronto native D-Pryde filled in for Blackbear, doing an amazing job of getting the crowd pumped for what was to come.&nbsp;SuperDuperKyle started his set with “The Force”, complete with a lightsaber battle.&nbsp;Some&nbsp;highlights from his set include dancing&nbsp;with Chauncey (also known as SuperDuperBrick) and watching Kyle take crowdsurfing literally, surfboard and all.</p><p>Being a performer isn’t just being able to sing. It’s being able to work a crowd, giving every single person in the venue the best night of their lives. Last night,&nbsp;<span>D-Pryde, SuperDuperKyle, and Hoodie Allen showed Toronto that they are most definitely top-notch performers.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Right from the get-go, Hoodie had the crowd engaged, singing and rapping along to every word. Doing the dance at the end of “Are U Having Any Fun?” had us in stitches, and his vocals in “King To Me” had some of us in tears. He made sure everyone was having a good time, whether&nbsp;you were right up against the barricades, near the back of the venue, or up in the mezzanine. It’s always a good time with confetti cannons.</p><p>Expect the unexpected at a Hoodie Allen show. By unexpected, we mean the whole crowd singing happy birthday to a fan, in addition to a few seconds of&nbsp;<span>“What’s My Age Again?” by Blink-182 and “Fat Lip” by Sum 41. Of course, it’s not a Hoodie Allen show without the inflatable raft!</span></p><p>Through it all, he had the smile of someone who loves what he’s doing, and who he’s doing it for.&nbsp; If we hadn’t realized it &nbsp;before, we realized it then-the Hoodie Mob isn’t just a fanbase, it’s a family. Even with the venue abruptly ending the show before the finale, he still made sure that we had the time of our lives.</p><p>Longtime fan or not, Hoodie Allen’s Happy Camper tour is definitely one you’ll want to catch before they wrap up!</p><p>Are you planning to see Hoodie Allen on any of the remaining Happy Camper tour dates?
