Adding to the acclaimed series list is the new series Dark Winds which has a rating of 7.8 on IMDB, an outright indication that fans won’t have to <a href=#>worry about the third season</a>; there will be one.</p><p>Based on the Tony Hillman novel, the series follows two police officers in the Navajo, a remote area near Monument Valley. The series has had quite an extensive reach, and it is<a href=#> reported to have over 2.2 million views</a>, and the numbers are still increasing. Here are all the updates and possibilities we have for the second season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dark Winds Season 3 Release Date: When will it air?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/dark-winds-release-date.jpg><p>If you were fully immersed in the first and second season’s plot, the news that the series is returning for the third season calls for a celebration. The series <a href=#>renewal was confirmed by AMC </a>just after the season two finale on September 2023 via Deadline. The first season premiered on June 12, 2022, with six episodes, and the <a href=#>season premiered on July 30, 2023</a>. The third will also have the same number of episodes as the first and second seasons of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">psychological thriller</a>, premiering on AMC and AMC+. We may get to binge on the thriller come in early 2025.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dark Winds Season 3 Plot: What will happen?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/dark-winds-plot.jpg><p>The first season followed Lieutenant Joe Learphon and his deputy Jim Chee’s <a href=#>investigation of the double murder case</a>. This case challenged their spiritual beliefs and what they stand for—the first season ended with wrapping up a car robbery case that the two had been working on for a while. The <a href=#>long overdue investigation revealed that the robbers</a> had been hiding people and money in the caves.</p><p>The second season again followed Jim Chee (Kiowa Gordon), aspiring to be an <a href=#>FBI undercover agent</a>, who <a href=#>exposed his corrupt boss</a> and decided to leave the reservation. Now, he is working as a private investigator in the Arizona area following his breakup with Manuelito.</p><p>Despite the series renewal, we are yet to <a href=#>receive updates on whether the series</a> will pick up from the season two finale or it will take a completely different direction. All that is known is that the second season will be purely based on one of Hillerman’s novels. The <a href=#>creators have already settled on the book</a>, and we will have to wait for future updates.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dark Winds Season 3 Cast: Who is returning?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/dark-winds-cast.jpg><p>The two Navajo investigative officers are Zahn McClarnon and Kiowa Gordon, who star as Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee respectively. Other casts include Noah Emeriti as Whitover, <a href=#>Jessica Matten (Frontier)</a> as Bernadette, <a href=#>Rainn Wilson (Mom)</a> as Devoted Dan, and Deanna Allison as Emma. With the series renewal, we expect all the cast to be back. The two police officers will be <a href=#>back investigating the social evils that loom</a> around them and putting away offenders. Chances are that we may see new faces in the upcoming season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dark Winds Season 3 Trailer: When can we watch it?</h2><p>The trailer of the psychological drama series is yet to be released, and if the production process is sped up, <a href=#>we might get a trailer in 2024</a>. If you have yet to watch the show’s first and second seasons, you can do so on AMC. Since the channel has some of the best TV shows, you can watch similar series before the third season’s debut. Major series include <a href=#>The Offer</a>, <a href=#>Lincoln Lawyer</a>, and <a href=#>Black Bird</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reviews and Ratings of Dark Winds Season 2</h2><p>The AMC Dark Winds Season 2 has got good ratings and reviews.
