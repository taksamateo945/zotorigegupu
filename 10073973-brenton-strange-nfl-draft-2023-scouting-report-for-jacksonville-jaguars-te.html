Though not a true burner for the position, Strange runs well for a 253-pounder. He's got the speed to threaten seams and crossers at a baseline level, which is enough to reasonably make him a three-level threat. Strange also plays with great burst. Whether it's his first few steps off the line or with the ball, Strange has a way of kicking it up two gears as soon as he wants to. That helps him greatly as a YAC threat, especially when paired with his toughness.</p><p>Strange also has nice tools as a blocker. He's not overwhelming, but Strange clears the thresholds when it comes to size and strength for in-line blocking. Better yet, Strange is pretty feisty and willing to get his hands dirty, which only serves to maximize the strength he does have.</p><p>On the flip side, Strange isn't a finished receiver yet. Strange's route-running, in particular, leaves something to be desired. He plays high and doesn't show the bend to get in and out of route breaks comfortably, leading to inconsistent separation. It's likely going to take him some time to iron out those skills in the NFL.</p><p>Strange also needs to prove himself more as a ball-winner. He has the size, strength, and explosive ability for it, but it wasn't a consistent part of his game in college.</p><p>Strange can be a viable TE2 out of the gate with the potential to grow into more down the line. His blend of size, speed, and explosion is enticing, and his blocking skills translate to being able to play both in-line and as a wing/H. The hope is that a couple years of NFL coaching can level-up Strange's route-running and contested catch ability.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 6.5 (Potential Role Player/Round 4)</p><p><b>OVERALL RANK</b>: 139</p><p><b>POSITION RANK</b>: TE9</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON</b>: Tommy Tremble</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ2iGeH%2BMm6mepqSku26%2F06uYp5%2BVYrunuIydqZqepGJ%2FcX6SZqqcp6Wptq%2BzjKucqaeiqXqnu9FmoZqbm6i8r8LIpaOeZZqWtLat0axkrZ0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
