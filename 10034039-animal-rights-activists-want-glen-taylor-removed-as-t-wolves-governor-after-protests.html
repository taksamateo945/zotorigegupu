A bird influenza broke out in March at the facility, and the response was as follows, per Arnovitz.</p>"To combat the highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemic, the company killed more than 5 million birds with a method called ventilation shutdown plus at one of its primary facilities in Iowa. Under the method, air flow into the industrial sheds where the birds reside is closed off. Activists deem the practice inhumane."<p>Direct Action Everywhere has filed complaints to authorities in Iowa, where the farm is located, that&nbsp;Rembrandt's violated the state's laws, according to Arnovitz.</p><p>They also want&nbsp;Taylor Corp., the parent company of&nbsp;Rembrandt Farms, to "donate the $11.3 million it received in federal funds to aid in a 2015 outbreak to public health and animal welfare organizations."</p><p>Three incidents have taken place at Timberwolves games this month alone.</p>Direct Action Everywhere <span class=acct>@DxEverywhere</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>DxE activists have disrupted 3 Minnesota &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Timberwolves?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Timberwolves&lt;/a> games in protest of the team owner’s factory farm, which used "&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VentilationShutDown?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VentilationShutDown&lt;/a>" to roast 5.3 million birds alive. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GlenTaylorRoastsAnimalsAlive?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GlenTaylorRoastsAnimalsAlive&lt;/a>&lt;br>Sign the petition:&lt;a href="https://t.co/6MxmNlxNj7">https://t.co/6MxmNlxNj7&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/qxvViItBEC">pic.twitter.com/qxvViItBEC&lt;/a></p><p>On April 12, one activist glued her hands to the floor near the basket in the second quarter of the Los Angeles Clippers at Timberwolves play-in game:</p>Bleacher Report <span class=acct>@BleacherReport</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>A fan was escorted off after attempting to glue themselves to the floor during the Clippers-Timberwolves Play-in Game &lt;a href="https://t.co/RreK0kjPSG">pic.twitter.com/RreK0kjPSG&lt;/a></p><p>On April 16, another activist chained herself to the back of the basket during Game 1 of the ongoing Timberwolves-Memphis Grizzlies first-round playoff series.</p>Bleacher Report <span class=acct>@BleacherReport</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>A woman chained herself to the back of the basket at the Timberwolves-Grizzlies game&lt;br>&lt;br>She was escorted out by security &lt;a href="https://t.co/mZC5y4hdeW">pic.twitter.com/mZC5y4hdeW&lt;/a></p><p>Both of those fans were wearing shirts that read "Glen Taylor Roasts Animals Alive."</p><p>Then last Saturday, a third activist stormed the court during Game 4 of the Wolves-Grizz series.
