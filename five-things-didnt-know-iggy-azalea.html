A former model and current pop star, it’s crazy to think she was just some girl from Australia who had dreams of pop and rap fame. Now she is pretty much a household name, with a distinct voice and stunning looks, she is hard to ignore. But what do we really know about her? This is the questions we posed when we came up with this list. Here are five things you didn’t know about&nbsp;Iggy Azalea.</p><p>(Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for NARAS)</p><p><strong>She Moved From Australia to Miami, Alone at 15 Years Old</strong></p><p><img decoding=async alt="Glastonbury Festival 2013 - Day 3" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/171879285.jpg width=594 height=389 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Iggy Azalea talks about how she spent a good chunk of her youth hitch hiking (not a smart idea, by the way) and how she eventually ended up in Miami, all by herself at the tender age of 15 years young. At that point she knew she had to make this dream happen or she would be eaten alive by this world. Looks like she made the dream happen.</p><p>(Photo by Ian Gavan/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Clueless Is One Of Her Favorite Movies</strong></p><p><img decoding=async alt="Philipp Plein Event - Milan Fashion Week Womenswear Spring/Summer 2014" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/181527048.jpg width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>You may have assumed this already about&nbsp;Iggy Azalea because of her Fancy video, but the pop/rap star is a huge fan of the 90’s movie, Clueless. Though many of us who were teens in the nineties were somewhat affected by that movie she absolutely loved it. Another note, she does a darn fine impression of Alicia Silverstone, too.</p><p>(Photo by Tullio M. Puglia/Getty Images for Philipp Plein)</p><p><strong>How She Got Her Name</strong></p><p><img decoding=async alt='Iggy Azalea Visits The "Elvis Duran Z100 Morning Show"' src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/485903297.jpg width=594 height=469 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The name&nbsp;Iggy&nbsp;Azalea has some pretty strange beginnings.&nbsp; What she did to get her name was she took the name of the childhood street she grew up on and she mashed it up with the name of her first pet.&nbsp;Iggy&nbsp;Azalea was the end result, and a perfect stage name for the larger-than-life songstress.</p><p>(Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Has a Beef With Miley Cyrus</strong></p><p><img decoding=async alt='Show At "Chime For Change: The Sound Of Change Live" Concert' src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/169781119.jpg width=594 height=386 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Okay, so we may be pushing it a little by calling it a beef.&nbsp; Basically Miley Cyrus has some very particular dance moves she has used in the last year or two to help get her more famous (or infamous) and if you ask Iggy, she was doing the moves first. I wont name the move in question here, but I do honestly believe we ALL know exactly what I am twerking about. Talking about. Darn auto-correct.</p><p>(Photo by Ian Gavan/Getty Images for Gucci)</p><p><strong>One of Her Best Friends is Fellow Pop Star Rita Ora</strong></p><p><img decoding=async alt="DKNY Artworks London - Arrivals" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/170406155.jpg width=594 height=386 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>It is nice to be able to surround yourself with people who at least understand what you do for a living. For that reason alone, it makes a lot of sense that these two would naturally gravitate towards friendship. They have even worked on the song Black Widow together to cement that bond on wax.</p><p>Were there any cool facts we missed?
