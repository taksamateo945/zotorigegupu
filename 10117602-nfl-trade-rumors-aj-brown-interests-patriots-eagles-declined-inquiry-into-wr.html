Brown speculation on social media today after he changed his avatar to a photo of Tom Brady &lt;a href="https://t.co/uGnrCqUbpM">pic.twitter.com/uGnrCqUbpM&lt;/a></p><p>Brown had an outstanding 2023, notching 1,456 yards and seven touchdowns just a year after picking up 1,496 yards and 11 touchdowns. If the Eagles were to open trade talks on him, plenty of teams would likely be willing to give Philadelphia a big haul.</p><p>After Brown changed his profile picture, he explained in a since-deleted tweet that he made the move because Brady is his favorite player and that he didn't intend to stir up any conversations:</p><p><i>"TB12 is my favorite player ever. I watch the dynasty and it brought back some memories from my childhood. Go look up what he did in 2015 when he was doubted/ disrespected. Yeah I see the disrespect. Motivated ... yes.

While those moves might not have much meaning behind them, they are certainly a topic of conversation given the situation.</p><p>For now, Brown will remain in Philadelphia, where he is under contract until 2026. When he becomes a free agent, perhaps New England will be his target destination.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWyDcX6Mp52lZaSnrqWxjKuspqeiqHqitoybqaivnmK2r8DEq5ysrKNivaLA0aKmratdmq6ouMSsZJ2dk6G2r7HDZqCnqaWev7p5yKerqGWnpw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
